A customizable desk lamp controlled with a 10 cents coin that acts as a touch control.
You can switch the light on and off with a single touch, or adjust the brightness keeping the touch.

The lamp uses an Atmega 2560 Pro microcontroller that can be programmed like any other Arduino board, so you can use the default program or make any changes you like!
Each pin of the atmega controls a single led, so you can adjust the brightness of each led individually using PWMs.

# What's needed
- an Atmega 2560 Pro board (a normal Atmega 2560 would be too big and will not fit into the lamp);
- nine 3V leds;
- 1MÎ© resistor;
- some wires and a soldering machine to realize the connections;
- strip connectors;
- a 3D printer.

## 1: Printing
In the _Stl_ folder you will find tree files. You have to print each file once.

## 2: Touch sensor
