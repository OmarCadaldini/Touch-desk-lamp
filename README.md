# Touch-desk-lamp
A customizable desk lamp controlled with a 10 censt coin that acts as a touch control.
You can switch the light on and off with a single touch, or adjust the brightness keeping the touch.

The lamp uses an Atmega 2560 Pro microcontroller that can be programmed like any other Arduino board, so you can use the default program or make any changes you like!
Each pin of the atmega controls a single led, so you can adjust the brightness of each led individually using PWMs.
